PURPOSE
-------

		1) Load the extension from the Chrome store, or use the source here to load unpacked in developer mode
		
		2) Ensure that the extension is enabled (Enabled by default) by seeing that the Piez image in the browser top right reads 'On'

		3) Open the developer tool bar by clicking "View > Developer > Developer Tools" in the browser OR hitting Command + Option + J (Mac)

		4) Ensure that cache is disabled when developer tools is open by navigating to settings in the developer tool pane, then select the "Disable cache (while devtools is open)" checkbox
